              Hey, I'm Stephanie. Most people call me Steph. I am a wife, a mom,
              a criminal justice and security nerd, and a Software
              Engineer. I can talk about serial killers and fingerprinting long
              enough to creep most people out. I love anything investigative and
              thrive when given a problem to solve. 
              <br />
              At work, I am known to be the person people go to with random
              questions even if it doesn't relate to my team. I may not have
              the answer but I will always put the effort in to try and figure
              it out. I have a can do attitude, enjoy troubleshooting and love
              building up a team through positivity. I may bring a bit of
              weirdness but I promise I will get the job done.
              <br />
              Mentorship is important to me. I enjoy having someone invested in my personal/professional growth. I also enjoy providing mentorship and helping others along their journey. 
              <br />
              As long as you're growing you're going in the right direction. ðŸª´
