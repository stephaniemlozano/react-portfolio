          Hey, I'm Stephanie. Most people call me Steph. I am a wife, a mom, a
          criminal justice and security nerd, and a Software Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can talk about serial killers and fingerprinting long enough to
          creep most people out. I love anything investigative and thrive when
          given a problem to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          At work, I am known to be the person people go to with random
          questions even if it doesn't relate to my team. I may not have the
          answer but I will always put the effort in to try and figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a can do attitude, enjoy troubleshooting and love building up a
          team through positivity. I may bring a bit of weirdness but I promise
          I will get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentorship is important to me. I enjoy having someone invested in my
          personal and professional growth. I also enjoy providing mentorship
          and helping others along their journey.
        </p>
        <p>As long as you're growing you're going in the right direction. ðŸª´</p>
